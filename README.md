# mapreduce_java
A folder containing the mapreduce project that I have written for my internship @ Ricoh

* containing a FindAndExcludeKeys project that allows us to define the FindKeyWords values and the ExcludeKeyWords values. Only users that have never had records containing ExcludeKeyWords values will be returned, together with the count of their records that contain FindKeyWords values.
