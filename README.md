# mapreduce_java
A folder containing the mapreduce project that I have written for my internship @ Ricoh


* containing a FindAndExcludeKeys project that allows us to define the FindKeyWords values and the ExcludeKeyWords values. Only users that have never had records containing ExcludeKeyWords values will be returned, together with the count of their records that contain FindKeyWords values. 


** Notice: I created these projects under the same WordCount class for simplicity. So the name of the file needs to be changed to "WordCount.java" in order for it to run properly.
