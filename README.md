# mapreduce_java
A folder containing the mapreduce project that I have written for my internship @ Ricoh


* FindAndExcludeKeys: allows us to define the FindKeyWords values and the ExcludeKeyWords values. Only users that have never had records containing ExcludeKeyWords values will be returned, together with the count of their records that contain FindKeyWords values. 
* CategoryFrequencyCount: allow us to define a number of FindKeyWords values. Count the number of records that contain each of these values.


** Notice: I created these projects under the same WordCount class for simplicity. So the name of the file needs to be changed to "WordCount.java" in order for it to run properly.
